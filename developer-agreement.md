### Third Party Developer Agreement

Assembly is committed to raising the standards of privacy and security applied to the management of education data.  In order to do this, we expect all Third Party Developers who connect to, or wish to connect to, the Assembly platform to sign and accept our Third Party Developer Agreement and comply with it at all times. You should also read this document in conjunction with our [Glossary of Terms](http://assembly.education/privacy/glossary/).

While this is an important and legally-binding document, we’ve tried to keep this agreement as readable and user-friendly as possible. We have, however, stuck to some conventional legal document practices (such as capitalisation of ‘You’ and ‘Us’ in relation to each party) where it’s helpful for clarity.

## Who do these terms apply to?

This agreement is between You, a Third Party Developer and Assembly Partner, and Assembly.  If you do not, or cannot, agree to these terms you should not use the Assembly platform.

## Our commitment to You

Assembly are committed to providing the highest quality tools for the purposes of education and school improvement.  Therefore, with respect to data security and privacy, we will not ask you to accept anything that we ourselves are unable to accept.  Like you, we agree to comply with the Data Security and Privacy Pledge below.  Our [Terms of Service](https://github.com/assembly-edu/terms-of-service/blob/master/terms.md) incorporate the standards outlined in the pledge, as well as additional commitments that we make to schools.
